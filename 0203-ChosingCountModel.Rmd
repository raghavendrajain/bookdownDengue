<!-- Choice of model.  -->

<!-- I want to check which model is better for moeling the dengue count data, whether it is Poisson, Quasi-Poisson, Negative-Binomial or Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial.  -->

```{r CountModel, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}

## We take the "Whole Lagged Data" data.frame and the list allDistrictLaggedData

countMean <- mean(WholeDataLagged$count, na.rm = TRUE)
countVar <- sd(WholeDataLagged$count, na.rm = TRUE)
countMean 
countVar
## The mean and variance are same.  

# 
# Not all the count data, meets the assumptions of the Poisson distribution. Thus, we need to test if the variance>mean or if the number of zeros is greater than expected



```
